# SatelliteSegmentation
Object recognition using aerial images
has become a topic of high interest due to the recent advancements in computer vision, machine learning and low cost high performance hardware which allows to process
lots of data in a reduced time, this technology offers the possibility of accurately distinguishing different types of objects, such as building roads vegetation and other categories, which can be used as support decision makers in several applications such as keeping up to date maps, improving urban planning environment monitoring and disaster prevention . In this paper we describe and analyze a model developed for the DSTL satellite imagery dataset from Kaggle competition. We will explore supervised deep learning models using fully connected neural networks forthe detection of objects labeled in 10 different classes.
